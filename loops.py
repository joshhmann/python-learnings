#Two kinds of loops - for loops and while loops 

# an iterable is an object that can return one of its elements at a time. 
#strings list and tuples 

#example
cities = ['new york city', 'mountain view', 'chicago']
for city in cities: 
    print(city)

#break out
people = ['john' 'will', 'janet', 'karen']

for person in people:
    print(person)
    if person == 'janet': 
        break


#continue 

for person in people:
    if person == 'janet':
        continue
    print(people)



#range 
#range(start=0, stop, step=1)
#start argument is the first number of the sequence 
#stop argument is 1 more than the last number of the sequence 
#step argument is the difference between each number in the sequence 

for i in range(len(people)):
    print(people[i])

for i in range(0, 10):
    print('number', i)

for i in range(5, 35, 5):
    print(i)

cities = ['new york city', 'mountain view', 'chicago', 'los angeles']

for index in range(len(cities)):
    cities[index] = cities[index].title()


#while loops execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.

count = 0
while count <= 10:
    print('count: ' count)
    count += 1 #count = count + 1


#create usernames

names = ["Joey Tribbiani", "Monica Geller", "Chandler Bing", "Phoebe Buffay"]
usernames = []

# write your for loop here
for name in names: 
    usernames.append(name.lower().replace(" ", "_"))
    

print(usernames)
